## -------Project Console-------
🖥
The purpose of this project is to provide myself with a custom page to display upon opening a new tab in a browser. It should display relevant information to my life, including, but not limited to:

- 🌓 Current and upcoming astronomy conditions
- 🆙 Upcoming events
- 📅 My Google calendar
- ✅ Remind me to check in on my friends
- 🗒 a notepad that stores information across session
- ⏱ the time in the three time zones that are relevant to me
- 🌧 Weather conditions in my current location

This SPA was built in React, Gatsby, and utilizes SCSS (not SASS), and is served via Netlify directly from the repo. Storybook was in no way necessary for this site, but I needed to see it used in a real world application in order to solidify abstract concepts.
