##-------Project Console-------

The purpose of this project is to provide myself with a custom page to display upon opening a new tab in a browser. It should display relevant information to my life, including, but not limited to:

- Current and upcoming astronomy conditions
- Upcoming events
- My Google calendar
- Remind me to check in on my friends
- a notepad that stores information across session
- the time in the three time zones that are relevant to me
- Weather conditions in my current location

This SPA was built in React, Gatsby, and utilizes SCSS (not SASS), and is served via Netlify directly from the repo.
