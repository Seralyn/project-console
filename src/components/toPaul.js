// I will say that I wish you had explained to me first why my joke was in poor taste and it crosses some limits for you before feeling any... regret? about our interaction, but that isn't how the human brain works and I certainly don't blame you for it. I suppose you may not realize this? but I'm quite afraid of running you off after how our first meeting went down. Why is it so important to me to not run you off? Despite whatever playful excuses you might suggest, it's because I greatly value yours and Noora's friendship. Before meeting you two, I was fighting off a major depressive episode on account of feeling profoundly lonely. I don't feel that way anymore and I am trying to make other friends so as to not develop some weird codependency/stray puppy syndrome, but it's challenging when my standards are so damned high. Finding you two so early on in my time here was the equivalent of tripping over an undiscovered gold mine to me. I usually have to live somewhere for many years before finding people with whom I resonate so strongly. And for a minute there, all I could think was "welp, you did it, you dumb fucking idiot... you ran him off and of course he'll tell Noora you're a problematic-as-fuck cunt and she'll bounce as well". I'm...really not used to making people feel uncomfortable and I apparently don't handle it well. I'm too much of an instinctual people pleaser, I guess. Making people feel like I am a problematic person hurts me deep inside.
